AMONGST THEM WAS A TRAVELLING TUTOR, AND THREE YOUNG GENTLEMEN, HIS

HIS HAND, (PROBABLY A CLASSIC AUTHOR,) BETWEEN WHICH, AND HIS PUPILS,
AND THE SCENERY, HE DIVIDED HIS ATTENTION IN ABOUT EQUAL PARTS. THERE
WAS A SPECIMEN OF THE ENGLISH GRUMBLER, BIG, BURLY, AND AS IF IN DANGER
OF CHOKING FROM THE TIGHTNESS OF HIS CRAVAT. EVERY ONE KNOWS HIM, HIS
PLEASANT WAYS, AND HIS CONSTANT FLOW OF GOOD HUMOUR AND CHEERFULNESS;
THAT IS HE, SITTING TO THE RIGHT. THERE WERE BESIDES, NUMEROUS YOUNG
GENTLEMEN FROM THE UNIVERSITIES, FROM THE ARMY, FROM THE BAR, ALL WITH
MORE OR LESS HAIR ON THEIR UPPER LIPS; AND THERE WAS A CAVALRY OFFICER
OF THE RUSSIAN GUARD, AND A PROFESSOR, ON HIS WAY TO HEIDELBERG, AND
LOOSE, DISHEVELLED, HAIRY, SMOKY YOUNG GERMANS, WITH LONG BEARDS, AND
LONGER PIPES. AND THERE WAS A BRITISH NOBLEMAN, AND A BRITISH ALDERMAN,
AND A BRITISH ALDERWOMAN; AND THERE WERE BRITISH LADIES WHOM I CAN’T
DESCRIBE, BECAUSE THEY WORE THOSE “UGLY” THINGS WHICH PREVENT THEM BEING
SEEN; INTELLIGENT YOUNG AMERICANS ON THEIR WAY ALL OVER THE WORLD; NUNS,
WITH THEIR QUIET, HAPPY FACES; RED REPUBLICANS FROM FRANKFORT, AND SNOBS
FROM LONDON.</p>

Brown, Jones, and Robinson have arrived at &mdash;&mdash;, the capital
of &mdash;&mdash;, a small German state (we won’t say which, as it would
be giving it an undue distinction, and might offend the others).</p>

<p class = "plain">
They have been received with distinguished consideration, the “local”
paper having announced their arrival as Count Robinson, Sir Brown, and
the Rev. Jones. They have been invited to be present at a grand review,
and Robinson&mdash;who amongst other necessaries in those portmanteaus
of his, carried a uniform as Captain of Yeomanry&mdash;thought that this
was just the proper occasion to appear in it. Accordingly, he rode on to
the ground upon a charger (hired), in the character of a warrior, with a
solemnity of countenance befitting the scene and his country, and
accompanied by Jones (also mounted), but in the costume of an ordinary
individual of the period. Brown preferred going on foot. That is
Robinson in the centre. Just at the time when he ought to be riding up
the line, inspecting the troops with the Grand Duke and his
staff&mdash;his horse (a “disgusting brute,” as Robinson afterwards
described him, “who could not have been in the habit of carrying
gentlemen”) suddenly stood on his hind legs, in the very middle of the
field, so that his rider was forced to cling on to him in an absurd
manner, in full view of the army, the people, and the court.</p>

THE ENTERTAINMENT COMMENCED AT 5 P.M., AND LASTED TILL 7. IT CONSISTED

END, IN AN EXTRAORDINARY STATE OF EXCITEMENT, FIZZING, LIKE THE
PERPETUAL GOING OFF OF SODA-WATER. THE THEATRE WAS LIGHTED (?) BY ABOUT
FOUR OIL LAMPS; AND SUCH WAS THE DARKNESS, THAT OUR TRAVELLERS&mdash;WHO
MAY BE SEEN, PERHAPS, THROUGH THE “DIM OBSCURE,” UP IN A PRIVATE
BOX&mdash;COULD SCARCELY DISCERN ANYTHING BUT THE WHITE UNIFORM AND
GLITTERING BAYONET OF AN AUSTRIAN SENTINEL IN THE PIT.</p>
